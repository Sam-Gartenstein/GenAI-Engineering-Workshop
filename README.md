# GenAI Engineering Workshop

A **hands-on workshop** designed for **Columbia Universityâ€™s QMSS students** to explore applied generative AI engineering.

---

## Workshop Overview

This workshop is divided into three parts, each focusing on practical skills and real-world applications of large language models (LLMs):

### Part 1: Getting Started with OpenAI APIs
- **Format:** Google Colab notebook  
- **Topics:** Basics of using OpenAI APIs, prompt design, and workflow setup.  
- **Notebook:** [Generative AI Getting Started (Part 1)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Sam-Gartenstein/GenAI-Engineering-Workshop/blob/main/Generative%20AI%20Getting%20Started%20Part%201.ipynb)

### Part 2: LLM-Based Synthetic Dataset Creation
- **Format:** Guided use case  
- **Topics:** How to generate synthetic data with LLMs for research and experimentation  
- **Notebook:** *Coming soon*

---

### Part 3: Advanced Topics in Generative AI
- **Format:** Hands-on exploration and discussion  
- **Topics:**
  - Model comparison and benchmarking  
  - Cost reduction strategies  
  - LLM-as-judge methodology for evaluations  
- **Notebook:** *Coming soon*
