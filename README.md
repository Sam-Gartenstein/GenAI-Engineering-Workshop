## Workshop Overview

This workshop is divided into three parts, each focusing on practical skills and real-world applications of large language models (LLMs):

### Part 1: Getting Started with OpenAI APIs
- **Format:** Google Colab notebook  
- **Topics:** Basics of using OpenAI APIs, prompt design, and workflow setup.  
- **Notebook:** [Part 1: Guide to OpenAI in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17-Grgrc4O6ZlH0Pa34ND-rM2MzrQwVuR?authuser=1)


### Part 2: LLM-Based Synthetic Dataset Creation
- **Format:** Guided use case  
- **Topics:** How to generate synthetic data with LLMs for research and experimentation  
- **Notebook:** [Part 2: Using LLM Agents for Synthetic Data Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Odm2F9mXqf1-lHVCQeKiDPXSEdGyCcPq?authuser=1#scrollTo=2PTBJOxLCkQQ)

### Part 3: Advanced Topics in Generative AI
- **Format:** Hands-on exploration and discussion  
- **Topics:**
  - Model comparison and benchmarking  
  - Cost reduction strategies
  - Types of AI Agents
  - LLM-as-judge methodology for evaluations  
- **Notebook:** *Coming soon*
